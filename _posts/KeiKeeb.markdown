description: A completely 3D Printed 40% Keyboard based off the "MiniVan" Layout. Powered by a Adafruit KB2040 Microcontroller, has RGB built into the case. Utilizes a 3 piece design; Main Plate (Switches and key mounting), Bottom Shell (Electronics and RGB) and Top Skirt (Aesthetic skirt around the body of the keyboard). The design was created by me in Fusion 360, 3D Printed on a BambuLabs P1S in Polymaker PETG. This project is currently not complete and requires some minor updates to the physical design, as well as updated QMK Firmware. There is currently 1 functional prototype and 1 non-functional prototype.
