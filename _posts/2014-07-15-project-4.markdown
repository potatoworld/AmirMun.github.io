description: This is a project that I undertook to learn more about the sheet metal design space within Fusion 360. This case is meant to be easy to assemble, extremely compact yet still able to hold enough 3.5" HDD's for a large storage array. It stands at 445mm tall and 250mm wide. Utilizes an ITX motherboard, small form factor GPU and a full size ATX PSU. https://github.com/potatoworld/VestaNAS/
